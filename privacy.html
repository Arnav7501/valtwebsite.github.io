  <h2>Eligibility and Age Requirement</h2>
  <p>The Services are intended for individuals who are at least sixteen (16) years old, or the age of majority in their jurisdiction, whichever is higher. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.</p>

  <h2>Account Registration and Security</h2>
  <p>To access certain features of the Services, you may be required to create an account.

  <h2>Use of Services</h2>
  <p>The Services may only be used for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.

  <h2>Integration</h2>
  <p>When you connect a wearable device or third-party application to the Services, you authorize the collection, processing, and display of data from that source. Data may include biometric information such as heart rate, movement patterns, sleep metrics, vocal analysis, environmental readings, and other health-related measurements. You may disconnect integrations at any time, which will stop new data from being collected. The accuracy of such data depends on the device or third-party provider, and no guarantee is made as to the precision or completeness of the information.</p>

  <h2>No Medical Advice</h2>
  <p>The Services are intended for informational and educational purposes only and are not medical devices unless explicitly certified as such. The insights provided should not be considered medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare professional before making decisions related to your health.</p>

  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content, designs, algorithms, software, trademarks, and related intellectual property within the Services are owned by or licensed to VALT.

Feedback or suggestions you provide may be used without compensation or obligation.</p>

  <h2>Purchases and Participation</h2>
  <p>Certain features or products may require payment or subscription. Pricing, availability, and features may change without notice. Beta or experimental features are offered “as is” without warranty, and participation is voluntary.</p>
  <p>You may choose to participate in research programs that use anonymized or aggregated data from your account or devices. Identifiable health data will only be used for research with your explicit consent. Data shared for research will be anonymized where possible.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>The Services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, VALT is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services.

  <h2>Modifications to Terms</h2>
  <p>VALT may update these Terms at any time, with changes taking effect immediately upon posting. Continued use of the Services after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
